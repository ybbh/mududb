### 1. AI-Assisted Database Engineering

Accelerates development cycles by using large language models (LLMs) to generate:

- **Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagrams**
- **Data Definition Language (DDL) Scripts**
- **Stored Procedures & Functions**

### 2. [Mudu Portable Data Access](procedure.md)

Seamlessly integrates:

- **Interactive** (for ad-hoc transaction)
- **Procedural** (for one-shot transactions)

### 3. Modern Hardware-Optimized Architecture

Maximizes resource efficiency through:

- **Asynchronous I/O** (optimized for NVMe/SSD)
- **Cooperative Concurrency** (lightweight threading with near-zero overhead)

### 4. Microkernel Architecture Design

Embraces modularity and extensibility:

- **Core Engine**: Handles only essential functions (storage, ACID, query parsing, query execution).
- **Plug-in Ecosystem**:
    - Extensions (e.g., JSON/Graph support)
    - External Runtime Modules (e.g., ML inference)
    - Custom Storage Engines
